## About the Project

This project is based on [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) for the purpose of my own learning JavaScript. 
This project was built from the ground up, with a very obvious inspiration from Plex
The Library is persistent and saved to the browser's 'Local Storage'
